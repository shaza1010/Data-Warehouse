# Data-Warehouse
This project builds a layered data warehouse (Bronze → Silver → Gold) over CRM and ERP CSV sources. Each layer has a clear role: ingestion, cleansing and normalization, and modeling for analytics. The end goal is to expose clean, integrated, analytics-ready views that can be used in BI tools or reporting systems.
